1. the lagrange multiplier initial choice is monumentally important 
   - I observed a linear growth of constraint error with time when I was starting from \lambda \neq 0 initial conditions, this happens faster with larger \Delta t timesteps 
   - for ideal gas testing, the algorithm appears to be working correctly â€” the constraint is satisfied precisely at each Langevin iteration. The warmup takes about 3 - 4 iterations, while the rest of Langevin iterations get it done in only 1 Ax = b solve.  


2. Does this still work for the Bose fluid? 


3. For the Bose gas, do we get the correct values for the pressure operator? 
   - Code pressure operator into CL_bosefluid.py, and then cp the fxn into the projected script file
